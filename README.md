# MasterMind CLI Game 🔴🟡🟢🔵

## 📝 About
This is a console-based implementation of the classic **MasterMind** board game. I created this project as an **additional university assignment**, following specific guidelines and tasks provided by my lecturer.

The goal was to build a flexible game engine in **C#** that supports different game modes and difficulty levels.

## 🚀 Features
The project covers **Tasks 1, 2, 3, and 5** from the assignment requirements:

* **Classic Mode (Task 1):** You try to guess the secret 4-color code generated by the computer.
* **Computer Solver Mode (Task 2):** You create a secret code, and the computer tries to guess it using a logic algorithm (Process of Elimination).
* **Custom Settings (Task 3):** You can change the code length (4 to 6) and the number of available colors (6 to 8).
* **Number Mode (Task 5):** You can play with digits (0-9) instead of colors.

## 🎮 How to Play
1.  Run the application.
2.  Select the game mode from the main menu:
    * **Option 1:** Classic Rules (Standard 4 colors).
    * **Option 2:** Custom Game (Configure size, colors, or use numbers).
3.  Follow the instructions on the screen.
    * **X (Red)** = Correct color in the correct place.
    * **O (White)** = Correct color but in the wrong place.

## 🛠️ Technologies
* **Language:** C#
* **Framework:** .NET (Console Application)
* **Architecture:** Logic is separated from the UI (`MasterMindEngine`, `ComputerSolver`, `Program`).

## 🏃 How to Run
You need the .NET SDK installed.

1.  Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Pepegakac123/MasterMindCliGame
    ```
2.  Navigate to the project folder:
    ```bash
    cd MasterMindCliGame/MasterMindCliGame
    ```
3.  Run the game:
    ```bash
    dotnet run
    ```
